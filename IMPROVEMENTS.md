# Blog Generation Prompt Improvements

## Overview

The blog generation prompts have been significantly enhanced based on the blogger.md philosophy to create more engaging, thoughtful, and transformative technical content.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt

The system prompt now provides much more detailed guidance:

- **Compelling Hooks**: Specific instructions to start with paradoxes, questions, or unexpected observations
- **Socratic Method**: Concrete examples of how to use questions throughout the content
- **First Principles**: Clear guidance on breaking down complex concepts to fundamental truths
- **Literary Excellence**: Emphasis on metaphors, narrative tension, and varied writing rhythm
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Structured approach to gradually unveiling complexity
- **Philosophical Depth**: Focus on the "why" behind technical concepts
- **Thought Experiments**: Encouragement to include "what if" scenarios
- **Broader Connections**: Linking technical concepts to universal patterns
- **Transformative Conclusions**: Ending with synthesis rather than summary

### 2. Improved User Prompt

The user prompt now provides a clear structure:

- **Content Analysis Phase**: Questions to deeply understand the video content first
- **Three-Part Structure**:
  - THE HOOK: Specific requirements for an irresistible opening
  - THE JOURNEY: Detailed guidance for the main body with 3-5 themes
  - THE TRANSFORMATION: Instructions for a memorable, thought-provoking conclusion
- **Critical Requirements**: Emphasis on accuracy, preserving speaker insights, and narrative flow
- **Tone Guidance**: "Late-night conversation with a brilliant friend" metaphor
- **Success Metrics**: Clear goals for what the blog should achieve

### 3. Technical Improvements

- **Model Update**: Using GPT-5 (released August 2025) for superior content generation
- **Token Limit**: Set to 8000 tokens for comprehensive blog posts
- **Temperature Settings**: Optimized for creative yet coherent writing (0.8)

3. **Literary Excellence**: Detailed guidance on metaphors, analogies, and narrative
4. **Depth and Thoughtfulness**: Focus on "why" questions and philosophical implications
5. **Accessible Complexity**: Progressive disclosure and concrete examples

## Expected Outcomes

Blog posts generated with these improved prompts should:

- Hook readers immediately with compelling openings

## Usage Example

```bash
# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Generate a philosophically rich technical blog
cargo run --bin ydl -- "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
  --generate-blog \
  --blog-lang english
```

The generated blog will now follow the enhanced prompts, creating content that not only informs but transforms how readers think about the subject matter.
